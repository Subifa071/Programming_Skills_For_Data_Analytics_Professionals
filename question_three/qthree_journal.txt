Instruction: You must write your own Python code (no imports of external libraries for Luhn). Your
code should be clear, well-documented (using comments), and produce readable outputs.
You may use AI tools for this section only as a developmental purpose (i.e. to help you
comprehend the concept.
Part B – Real-Life Banking Case Study (7 marks)
A bank is processing new customer account numbers and credit card numbers. Some numbers
are flagged as invalid after running through your Luhn validation program.
Extend your Python program to:
1. Identify which of the given sequences would be rejected by the bank system.
2. For each invalid sequence, print the corrected account/credit card number (original digits
plus the right validation digit).
3. Determine which number would require the largest correction (validation digit furthest
from 0).
4. In a short explanation (in code comments or a short print statement), discuss how the Luhn
algorithm protects the bank from common data entry errors and potential fraud (e.g.,
mistyped digits, single-digit mistakes).
Hint: Think about how the algorithm can detect accidental errors in long sequences like real credit
card numbers.
This section should be completed independently, without the use of AI tools.
Part C – Reflection (not more than 200 words) (5 marks)
In a short-written reflection, discuss:
• Why the Luhn algorithm is widely used in banking and identification systems.
• Advantages of the algorithm you noticed while coding it (e.g., error detection, simplicity).
• Limitations you encountered (e.g., some digit transpositions go undetected).
• If you were to design an improved version, what modification would you suggest and why?

comprehend the concept.

Final Notes:

This program will provide the functionality for validating, correcting, and analyzing customer account numbers using the Luhn algorithm.

It helps in detecting errors in long sequences like credit card numbers, ensuring that mistakes in input data (such as mistyped digits) are caught before being processed.
