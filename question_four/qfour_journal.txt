Question 4
You have to use a Simple Moving Average (SMA)
(https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sma.asp) to find 10 companies from the S&P 500
which maximises returns if you hold these stocks in your portfolio for 50 days and that have
same period value for the SMA. You should take historic data for the last 10 years on a daily
basis, either by using the yahoo_fin Python library (http://theautomatic.net/yahoo_fin-
documentation) or by downloading the data from https://finance.yahoo.com. You can use
any Python libraries and IDE you would like but I do recommend using Pandas
(https://pandas.pydata.org), which should already be available to you if you have Anaconda
installed. You are not required to do any statistical tests or split the data into training and
testing to choose the best SMAs, instead you have to select the one that has the highest
forward return for the selected time period (50 days) for each stock. (30 marks)
There is a blog post which should be more than enough to provide explanations and a good
starting point to get an idea of the code structure:

Please note that the library they use to get the stocks is not working anymore, that is why I
suggested changing it to yahoo_fin. As I have said before, your solution does not have to be
as complex as the one described in the blog post, we only care about those days when the
close price is above the SMA and calculate the forward return.
