Question 5
You are an analyst at a retail company that sells a diverse range of products across multiple
regions. Management has requested an automated Excel report to evaluate sales performance,
costs, discounts, and profits for all product categories.
Your task is to create and automate this report in Excel while demonstrating your problem-solving
and data handling skills.
A. Excel Worksheet Setup
1. Create an Excel workbook with the following columns:
Product | Region | Units Sold | Unit Price | Manufacturing Cost | Revenue | Discount | Profit.
2. Populate the first five columns ensuring:
o Product: 25 distinct products, with 5 from each category: Electronics, Furniture,
Apparel, Food, and Stationery.
o Region: Assign each product to a region: Asia, Europe, Africa, North America, or
South America.
o Units Sold: Randomly select numbers between 50 and 800 units.
o Unit Price (UK £): Randomly select numbers between £20 and £150.
o Manufacturing Cost (UK £/unit): Randomly select numbers between £5 and £100.
3. Business Rule: Products with Units Sold > 400 are eligible for a 10% sales discount applied
to total revenue.
B. VBA Macro Development
• Develop a VBA macro that:
1. Calculates Revenue = Units Sold × Unit Price
2. Calculates Total Cost = Units Sold × Manufacturing Cost
3. Applies Discount according to the business rule.
4. Calculates Profit = Revenue − Total Cost − Discount
• The macro must be able to process all rows automatically.
C. Execution and Documentation
1. 2. Run the macro to populate Revenue, Discount, and Profit.
Prepare a short process report including:
o How the dataset was created and structured
o How the macro was designed and coded
o Explanation of discount logic and profit calculations
D. Submission Requirements
• Submit:
1. 2. 3. Excel workbook showing data before and after macro execution.
Word document containing the VBA code from the editor.
A process report describing your approach, challenges, and rationale.
Important Note:
• You must generate your own dataset not syndicated or smart dataset; using AI to
produce the data, Excel formulas, or VBA code is strictly prohibited.
• The goal is to demonstrate practical Excel and VBA skills in a real business scenario.
• This task also embeds sustainability and inclusivity elements: students will work with
diverse regional/product data and apply responsible business logic (e.g., discount rules),
ensuring outputs are fair, transparent, and inclusive.

Below are some best practices for writing journals:
• Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure the documentation is clear and to the point.
• Consistency: Maintain a consistent style and format throughout the document.
• Comprehensive Coverage: Cover all aspects of the project, including objectives,
implementation, testing, and results.
• Use of Visuals: Incorporate diagrams, charts, and screenshots to enhance understanding.
