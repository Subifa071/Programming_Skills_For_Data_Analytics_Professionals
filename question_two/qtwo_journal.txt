Question 2
Write a program to create the wheel of fortune. The following requirements must be met:
1. The software shall let the user decide a word or phrase for the player to guess.
2. The software shall allow the player to “spin a virtual wheel” to get a point value.
3. The software shall allow the player to guess a letter for the word or phrase.
4. The software shall ensure that if the letter is in the word or phrase, they earn points based
on the number of occurrences of that letter multiplied by the spun point value.
5. The software shall ensure that the game ends when the player has guessed the entire
word or phrase. (15 marks)

Task Description

The objective of this task was to implement a simplified Wheel of Fortune game in Python. The program allows a user-defined word or phrase, random point allocation via a virtual wheel, and scoring based on correctly guessed letters.

Implementation Details

Designed a modular program using multiple functions.

Implemented a random wheel spin using Python’s random module.

Used sets to track guessed letters efficiently.

Ensured points were awarded based on the number of letter occurrences multiplied by the wheel value.

Included input validation to prevent invalid guesses and empty words.

Challenges Encountered

Handling spaces within phrases without requiring them to be guessed.

Ensuring repeated guesses were not rewarded multiple times.

Maintaining clear user feedback during gameplay.

How Challenges Were Addressed

Automatically revealed spaces in the displayed word.

Used a set to track guessed letters and prevent duplicates.

Improved output formatting and validation checks.

Time Management

Planning game logic: ~30 minutes

Coding core functionality: ~60 minutes

Testing edge cases and adding documentation: ~45 minutes
