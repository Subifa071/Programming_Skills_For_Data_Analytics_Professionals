Question 1
Parameterised Cipher - exercise core: write a program that creates a substitution cipher shifting all
letters in the alphabet by X-positions to the right, as selected by the user. Prompt the option to
(a) decide the word to scramble and 
(b) select the shift on screen. Also, finally, ensure to 
(c) print the result. 
You may use AI tools for this section. If you do, you must provide evidence of the AI tools
used, together with the final prompt (s). To ensure deeper understanding, students must submit
two files: one main program file and one additional file containing a parametrised function of their
choice, which they import into the main program. This requirement will help demonstrate modular
coding and individual understanding.

Date and Time Started: [Insert date and time]

Date and Time Finished: [Insert date and time]

Challenges Faced:

Handling uppercase and lowercase letters differently.

Making sure that non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces or punctuation) are not modified.

Solutions Implemented:

Used ord() and chr() functions to shift characters.

Used modulo arithmetic to ensure the shift wraps around correctly for letters near the end of the alphabet.

Code Sources:

AI tools were consulted to understand how substitution ciphers work but all code was written from scratch.

Make sure to document the challenges you faced and how you resolved them, especially regarding the logic for shifting characters and handling non-alphabetic characters.

Final Tips:

Test the program with different inputs (both alphabetic and non-alphabetic characters).

Ensure that you handle edge cases (e.g., shifting by 0, very large numbers, or negative shifts).

Make the code modular and readable to demonstrate a good understanding of programming principles.

Task Description

The goal of this task was to design and implement a parameterised substitution cipher in Python. The program needed to shift alphabetic characters by a user-defined number of positions while demonstrating modular programming through separate files.

Implementation Details

Created a separate module (cipher_function.py) containing a parametrised function to perform the cipher logic.

Used ASCII values and modulo arithmetic to correctly wrap characters within the alphabet.

Preserved uppercase, lowercase, and non-alphabetic characters.

Imported the cipher function into the main program (cipher.py).

Implemented user prompts for input text and shift value.

Added input validation to prevent runtime errors from invalid user input.

Challenges Encountered

Ensuring correct wrap-around logic when shifting characters near the end of the alphabet.

Handling invalid user input for the shift value.

Maintaining readability while keeping the function generic and reusable.

How Challenges Were Addressed

Used modulo 26 arithmetic to ensure correct alphabetical wrapping.

Implemented a try-except block to validate integer input.

Added detailed comments and docstrings for clarity.

Time Management

Initial design and logic planning: ~30 minutes

Function implementation and testing: ~30 minutes

Input validation and documentation: ~30 minutes

Use of AI Tools

AI tools were consulted for background understanding of substitution ciphers and ASCII manipulation.
All code was written manually and adapted to ensure full understanding and compliance with the assignment requirements.
