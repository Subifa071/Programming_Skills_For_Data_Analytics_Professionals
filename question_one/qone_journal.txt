Question 1
Parameterised Cipher - exercise core: write a program that creates a substitution cipher shifting all
letters in the alphabet by X-positions to the right, as selected by the user. Prompt the option to
(a) decide the word to scramble and 
(b) select the shift on screen. Also, finally, ensure to 
(c) print the result. 
You may use AI tools for this section. If you do, you must provide evidence of the AI tools
used, together with the final prompt (s). To ensure deeper understanding, students must submit
two files: one main program file and one additional file containing a parametrised function of their
choice, which they import into the main program. This requirement will help demonstrate modular
coding and individual understanding.

Example Journal Entry:

Date and Time Started: [Insert date and time]

Date and Time Finished: [Insert date and time]

Challenges Faced:

Handling uppercase and lowercase letters differently.

Making sure that non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces or punctuation) are not modified.

Solutions Implemented:

Used ord() and chr() functions to shift characters.

Used modulo arithmetic to ensure the shift wraps around correctly for letters near the end of the alphabet.

Code Sources:

AI tools were consulted to understand how substitution ciphers work but all code was written from scratch.

Make sure to document the challenges you faced and how you resolved them, especially regarding the logic for shifting characters and handling non-alphabetic characters.

Final Tips:

Test the program with different inputs (both alphabetic and non-alphabetic characters).

Ensure that you handle edge cases (e.g., shifting by 0, very large numbers, or negative shifts).

Make the code modular and readable to demonstrate a good understanding of programming principles.
